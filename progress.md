   - Add theme guidelines for new components 

## April 15, 2024
- Fixed web version SSR error with AsyncStorage:

  - Root cause: AsyncStorage trying to access window during server-side rendering
  - Implemented custom storage adapter for Supabase auth in lib/supabase.ts
  - Created conditional checks for window existence before calling AsyncStorage methods
  - This properly handles server-side rendering when window is not defined
  - Modified supabase client to use this custom storage adapter instead of AsyncStorage directly
  - Solution improves web compatibility without affecting mobile functionality 

## April 20, 2024 (continued)
- Updated project priorities based on new information:
  - No valuable data exists in Firebase to migrate
  - Revised todo list to focus on removing Firebase dependencies completely
  - Updated completion status from ~70% to ~75% since data migration is no longer required
  - Database schema migration is now considered 100% complete instead of 95%

- Next steps revised:
  1. Remove all remaining Firebase dependencies:
     - Identify and remove all Firebase imports and code across the codebase
     - Check for Firebase-specific functionality that needs Supabase replacements
     - Remove Firebase packages from package.json
     - Test the app thoroughly after Firebase removal
  2. Complete testing checklist with focus on authentication and CRUD operations
  3. Resolve iOS deployment issues
  4. Add documentation and polish features 

## April 20, 2024 (continued)
- Removed remaining Firebase dependencies:
  - Deleted `constants/firebaseConfig.ts` file containing Firebase initialization
  - Updated `hooks/useAuth.ts` to use Supabase authentication instead of Firebase

- App can now function completely without Firebase backend 

## April 20, 2024 (continued)
- Removed placeholder content from the app:
  - Removed hardcoded sample emergency contacts from emergency.tsx

  - Improved consistency with other screens that use live Supabase data 

## April 20, 2024 (continued)
- Removed debug code from the expense tracker component:
  - Removed all console.log debug statements from the real-time subscription setup

  - Expenses: Verified delete functionality in handleDelete with Supabase integration and success alerts
  - Emergency Contacts: Confirmed delete contacts functionality with confirmation dialog
  - Calendar/Events: Verified event deletion functionality with proper database integration and alerts
  - All components consistently implement:
    - Confirmation dialogs before deletion to prevent accidental deletions
    - Success messages after successful deletion
    - Error handling for failed deletion operations
    - Immediate UI updates after deletion (optimistic updates)
    - Database synchronization for persistent changes
  - This ensures all components that allow adding items also support deleting them 

## May 5, 2024

  - Previously expenses could only be deleted via a long press gesture, which wasn't discoverable
  - The new delete button uses a trash icon with a subtle error-colored background
  - Positioned in the top-right corner of each expense card for easy access
  - Maintains the same confirmation dialog and success message as before
  - Improves discoverability of the delete functionality
  - Provides a more consistent UI with other components that have visible delete buttons 

## April 15, 2024
